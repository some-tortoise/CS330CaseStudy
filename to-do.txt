PROBABLY WON'T DO
1. Use Fibonacci Heap in Dijkstra ??
2. Look into Differential Heurisitcs
3. Look into checking if KD tree is balanced

DEFINITELY NEED TO DO
4. Show A* and A* To All are more efficient and still accurate enough compared to Dijkstra and Dijkstra To All
   i. Specifically measure how often A* overshoots
5. Show getApproxHaversine is more efficient and still accurate enoough compared to getHaversine
6. Show findClosestInKD is more efficient and still accurate enough compared to findClosestNode
