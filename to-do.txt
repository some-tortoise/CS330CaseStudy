1. Use Fibonacci Heap in Dijkstra ??
2. Look into Differential Heurisitcs
3. Look into checking if KD tree is balanced
4. Measure A* overshoot and accuracy
5. Measure A* v2 accuracy and A* to all (think it is the same)
6. Show approx haversine is good
7. Show findClosestInKD returns approximately close node. Measure accuracy?
8.
